## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
In this project, I have applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause. Next, I have applied a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. Later, I evaluated several supervised learners of my choice on the data, and came up with the best suited algorithm for the solution. Afterwards, I have optimized the model to analyze its performance. Finally, I explored the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

## Project Highlights
This project is to get acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

Things I have learnt by completing this project:
- How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
- How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
- What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
- How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

This project contains four files:

- `finding_donors.ipynb`: This is the main file where I have workee on the project.
- `census.csv`: The project dataset. 
- `visuals.py`: A Python file containing visualization code that is run behind-the-scenes. Do not modify
- `report.html`: final submission file
