    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:The type and kind of the data we have plays a key role deciding which algorithm is used for building a predictive model.Based upon the above statement, the three algorithms that I think are appropriate for this problem are Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression and Ensemble methods (AdaBoost). The justification for choosing these three is a follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Support vector machines \n",
    "\n",
    "1. This technique is used in the area where facial detection is one of the key parameter of their application like ID card scanner systems, biometrics, photography. In facial detection system, SVM is used to create a boundary around the face by separating the face and no-face areas.\n",
    "2. The model perform well when the margin of the classifier is maximized and the margin depends upon the support vectors. These support vectors are the data points that are closer to the hyperplane and inflluence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. There is another hyper parameter called C, which needs to be tuned using Grid Searchtechnique to maximize the margin but at the same time not having too much classification errors. Error= C (multipled by) classification error + margin error. If we keep C to be small, margin will increase but we will have classification errors and if C is large, margin will reduce and the classification errors will be greatly reduced.\n",
    "3. The above justification holds for this point also which asks when does the model perform poorly? Choosing the right value of C by applying Grid Search technique, we can have a model that performs well and generalize well. Similarly, while using Kernel technique in SVM, there is another hyperparameter that needs to be fine-tuned using Grid Search technique that is gamma. Large value of gamma may lead to overfitting of the data and small value of gamma lead to underfitting. \n",
    "4. The number of samples in the data are <100K as per Scikit machine learning map, we can go for Linear SVM. Secondly, this is a binary classification problem, SVM works well for binary classification problems. Third, it provides significant accuracy with less computational power. Hence, this algorithm will be preferred for least computational power consumption and good accuracy. Reference: https://hackernoon.com/choosing-the-right-machine-learning-algorithm-68126944ce1f\n",
    "        \n",
    "       Logistic Regression\n",
    "        \n",
    "1. The major application of this model is for binary classification or in other words the categorical outcome of any task for example whether a cancer is malignant or benign, email is spam or not, whether a student gets admission in a university or not. It is used in almost every industry like in the examples given,; medical, education etc.\n",
    "2. The strength of this model is the simplicity/ ease in its implementation. When the data is linearly separable, it is best to use logistic regression tha any other classification technique.\n",
    "3. This algorithm can not be used for non-linear problems since its decision surface is linear. Secondly, it needs more data to train well and generalize well. It tends to overfit and hence require regularization.\n",
    "4. In the finding donors data set, first advantage to use this algorithm is that logistic regression is the first and simplest binary classification algorithm that one can think of. This algorithm works for every kind of dataset and is the first choice for binary classification for everyone.\n",
    "     \n",
    "       Ensemble method (AdaBoostClassifier)\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "1. Adaboost is an algorithm specifically for binary classification.One of the application is in banking in which it is used to predict the loyal customers (customers who pay back the loan properly), fraud customers (customeres with bad records like not paying back the loan on time or anything like this). In general, the ensemble approach have also been used by the winning team of Netflix challenge for building a recommender system and hence become more popular after then.\n",
    "2. The strength of this model is that it produces a stronger classifier (model) by combining a set of weak models . \n",
    "3. This algorithm is sensitive to noisy data and outliers and hence performs poorly.\n",
    "4. This is a binary classification problem, hence we preferred Adaboost. Secondly, the data has been processed to remove outliers, so this model will be least prone to overfitting and will provide good generalization.\n",

    "**Answer: The evaluation performed in the last code snippe clearly justifies AdaBoost Ensemble method to be the best performing algorithm in both training and testing phase. The F-score of the AdaBoost is the largest among the three in both training and prediction. However, the training and testing time of this algorithm is also the largest among the algorithms that we have worked upon. But this time is in mere fraction of seconds and we can not state that the better performance  is attained at the cost of more training time. The data has been preprocessed that helped for the improved performance in AdaBoost. Secondly., the more time is due to the training of n- number of weak learners(algorithms) instead of one in other two models. This algorithm is best suited for this data; first: the output class is binary, second: the data does not contain nay outliers, third: there are too many features, so a decision tree can not be used for this kind of data, hence a combination of decision trees are working to provide a better solution. Also, the F-score of the Adaboost algorithm improved with the increase in the training dataset size. The more training data you provide to an algorithm, the better generalization performance can be obtained.  **"

    "**Answer:A weak learner is an algorithm that performs poorly but is better than the random guess or a naive predictor. However, this computationally the simplest algorithm and easy to train. If we can combine several weak learners by providing high weightage to the wrongly classified samples or in other words, concentrating on the data samples which are not correctly classified we can have an algorithm that will come up as a stronger than the initial one and that is called the Boosting algorithm. In the initial training phase of the Boosting model, same weights are assigned to all samples, At each subsequent step of iteration, we apply the base algorithm (which is decision tree in this case) to the training set but giving more weight value to the incorrectly classified samples and reduce the weights of the correctly classified samples.In this way, at each susequent step, weak learner is forced to concentrate on the samples which are not correctly classified by the previous one in the sequence. In this way, the final model after n-iterations will be able to correctly classify all the samples in the dataset. Hence, when presented with an unseen data sample, the algorithm will predict it correctlty.\n",
    "We have chosen Adaboost classifier model which is actually a combination of many weak learners (decision tress) that does not provide good performance when used alone. However, when we have a weighted combination of these weak learners providing more weights to the samples which are incorrectly classified with every subsequent training step (iteration), they came up with a stronger learner (model) which provides the performance better than the other trained models and naive classifier. The performance of the models is judged on two parameters: accuracy and F-score. Accuracy defines what ratio of the correct classification has been achieved. Also, the data set is skewed, as the number of people with income more than 50K dollars were just one third of the people with earnnings less than 50K dollars. Hence, the better suited performance metric for skewed dataset is F-score. We calculated and compared the F-score of all the algorithms and again AdaBoost's F-score was the largest among the three.\n",
    "The data that was given, has been preprocessed to convert the categorical variables to numerical ones. It is also checked for any outliers and then normalized to remove these outliers. Since, Adaboost is highly sensitive to noisy data and outliers. Removing them have made it perform the best among the three chosen algorithms. Also, this algorithm is designed only for binary classification problems and hence it is the algorithm of choice for us.  ** "

    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",

Most of the people in the age range of 30-45 are earning more as per the data. Next is the hour per week. People who work >= 45 hours per week are likely to earn more. Then, more is the education-num in terms of his /her qualification, more the money he/she earn. Education num is basically representing the categorical fetaure education-level. And the least important factor is capital-gain, where people with income>50K likely to have capital gain more than 5000.**"

    "**Answer: There is only one different feature in my selection and the algorihtm's selection. As per my understanding and analysis of the data, I have chosen occupation to be the most important feature as all the high-rank position individual's are earning more than 50K dollars whereas the algorithm has chosen Capital-loss as the most relevant feaure whih is nowhere in my selection list. The other four features are same; Age, Hours/week, education-num and capital gain. However the order of their relevance/importance is different from the one shown in the plot. Capital loss and gain features are relevant because an individual's final income greatly depends upon the gain/loss he had in stock or any other kind of investments. The other factors remains the same. The person who is more educated will also likely to earn more. The occupation feature that I have chosen somehow becomes redundant with the education-num, as more educated person will likely to be at the good position. **"

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

The model with reduced features can be used for predicting the potential donors. However, if we take into account the time required to train and predict, this model's training time is hardly one second and the prediction time is even less i.e. fraction of second. Therefore, we should not compromise on the training and testing performance of this model considering it consuming fraction of seconds to train and test. Hence, I will not consider the model with reduced data as the training set in this particular case. **"
